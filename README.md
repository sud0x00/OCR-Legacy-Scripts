# OCR-Legacy-Scripts
Old scripts created during the OCR Project , out of which some aren't working

I'm not fixing errors even if I find any , hence legacy....


## Some observations related to the scripts 

### 1: 
The easiest way to not actually install libraqm, but to get it working in python / PIL is:

    Download the unofficial build dlls from here(https://www.lfd.uci.edu/%7Egohlke/pythonlibs/) (search for "libraqm")
    
    Copy them to the same directory as your python.exe

Restart you kernel and it should work.

### 2: 

sop.7z contains a basic React UI for the OCR website.
